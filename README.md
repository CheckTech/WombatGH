# WombatGH #

This is the source code for the Wombat Grasshopper library. The most recent build can be found on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/wombatgh)

## How to Use ##

This project is built using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), so you'll need to install that to get started. After that:
1. `git clone https://github.com/woodsbagot/WombatGH.git `
2. Open the solution (WombatGH/WombatGH.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution (right click on Solution 'WombatGH' -> Build Solution)
4. The Grasshopper library (GHA) file is configured to build to `WombatGH/bin/<config>/WombatGH.gha`. You'll need to copy it to your Grasshopper components directory, or use GrasshopperDeveloperSettings command to tell Grasshopper to look in your /debug/ directory for the assembly.
